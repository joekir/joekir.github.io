Joe is a Security Researcher at BlackBerry, the thoughts and opinions of his employer are of course not his, and the converse also applies. 

He's interested in information security, cryptography, reverse engineering, software development and testing.

When not doing the worky stuff he might be found road cycling, rock climbing or being annoying.

To contact, see below.

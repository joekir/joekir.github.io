### About

My technical interests are information security, cryptography, reverse engineering, software development and testing. Résumé at [/resume](/resume).

I spend my spare time road cycling in the summer and playing ice hockey in the winter.

For the `über-top-secret-tinfoilers` you can find my PGP info at [https://keybase.io/joekirwin](https://keybase.io/joekirwin).

### About

My technical interests are information security, cryptography, reverse engineering, software development and testing. Résumé at [/resume](/resume).

I spend my spare time road cycling and learning [Brazilian jiu-jitsu](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brazilian_jiu-jitsu).

For the `über-top-secret-tinfoilers` you can find my PGP info at [https://keybase.io/joekirwin](https://keybase.io/joekirwin).

<p>Don't pretend to be anyone, it can lead to disastrous consequences!<br />I learned this the hard way this week with PowerShell remoting and WCF's named pipes.</p>
<p>As my current company had a large amount of integration tests that needed to be executed via scripting. I created a c# commandlet wrapper around <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-CA/library/jj155796.aspx" target="_blank">vstest.console.exe</a> that composed the test category query, copied dependencies, published the results etc. This was then to be called remotely using PowerShell remoting.<br />I mostly followed Keith Hill's <a href="https://rkeithhill.wordpress.com/2009/05/02/powershell-v2-remoting-on-workgroup-joined-computers-%E2%80%93-yes-it-can-be-done/" target="_blank">blog post</a> on how to set up credssp and delegate credentials, in a similar fashion to Kerberos.</p>
<p>vstest.console.exe starts up one or many vstest execution engine processes in clr2/clr4 and x86/x64 flavours, depending on the configurations passed and the test category query string. The parent process communicates with the child processes via wcf named pipes in the format net.pipe:///TestExecutor/.</p>
<p>After running the script everything appeared to work as designed, except when reviewing the child process with taskmanager and <a href="http://technet.microsoft.com/en-ca/sysinternals/bb896645.aspx" target="_blank">procmon</a>, the child process named vstestexecutionengine.exe would only stay up for 60 seconds and the memory would not increase much over the base instantiation of 8MB. Based on when I had run the tests locally on the machine, the memory consumption should have sky rocketed.<br />The 60 second timeout was a total read herring and led me down the path of investigating all sorts of <a href="http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/hh847813.aspx" target="_blank">wsman</a> client and server timeouts and memory maximums and PSSession timeout properties, based on the surface evidence that I had this seemed like a sound approach. Not a chance...</p>
<p>I then modified the C# commandlet to verbose log all of the standard output and standard errors from the vstest console process and this yielded the result that led me to the solution.<br />
<blockquote class="tr_bq"><span style="font-size:x-small;">"Error: Failed to initialize client proxy: could not connect to .<br />Error: There was no endpoint listening at net.pipe://localhost/TestExecutor/4504 that could accept the message. This is often caused by an incorrect address or SOAP action. See InnerException, if present, for more details.</span>"</p></blockquote>
<p>I found an enlightening <a href="http://kennyw.com/?p=102" target="_blank">blog post</a> from someone called Kenny W on the subject that finally gave me the answer.<br />
<blockquote class="tr_bq"><i><b>"User tokens that are marked with an impersonate flag* are placed in the NETWORK USER group, its SID is explicitly denied access to WCF named pipes, as a security design concept"</b></i></p></blockquote>
<p>*using Kerberos/Credssp/some other credential delegation authentication protocol</p>
<p>In the end to allow me to remotely start up the processes within the commandlet I had to <a href="http://technet.microsoft.com/en-ca/sysinternals/bb897553.aspx" target="_blank">psexec</a> (sysinternals) as system. Not elegant, but the only workaround I had available.</p>

<p>In SP2010 you can create custom document libraries that integrate with Microsoft Office xml based documents (docx/pptx/xslx etc.) and allow you to reuse SharePoint Office content. For example the "Slide Library" for reusable PowerPoint slides.</p>
<p>Here's what you need to do to access these features:
<ul>
<li>Enable "SharePoint Server Enterprise Site Features" at the site level</li>
<li>Enable WebDav support on an end user level, to do this you need to activate the "Desktop Experience" feature on the client OS on which you're using Office 2010</li>
</ul>
<p>I always forget that the WebDav integration with SharePoint is not a server setting, its a client setting!</p>

<p>I'm really grateful that some Universities are taking this open approach to learning. I personally have found this <a href="https://www.coursera.org/course/ml" target="_blank">Machine Learning </a>course from Stanford very interesting so far. The course and assignments don't start till April 2013, however it seems that you can preview all the lectures without signing up for the assignments, whatever works best.</p>
<p>I haven't looked into their <a href="http://online.stanford.edu/courses" target="_blank">other offerings</a> yet, but there are other Universities on board such as Harvard, MIT and other open video lecture sites such as <a href="https://www.khanacademy.org/" target="_blank">Kahn Academy</a></p>

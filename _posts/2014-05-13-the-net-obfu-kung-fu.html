<p>Recently, I've been looking into the various types of .Net obfuscation, some commercial obfuscators. But mainly hand rolled anti-disassembly/decompilation.</p>
<p>Some interesting ones I found today, were where the reflected code would not compile. Meaning that some random opcodes were injected post compilation that are still runtime compatible.</p>
<p>And also saw ones where non .Net opcodes were injected before a jump non-conditional, effectively padding with junk, so that on linear parsing of the file (top-bottom) dissasembly/decompilation may fail. Whereas for the runtime logical execution it would never encounter such problems.</p>
<p>Impressive stuff!</p>

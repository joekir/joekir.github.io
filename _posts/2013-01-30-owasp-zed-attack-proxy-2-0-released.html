<p>OWASP (Open Web Application Security Project) <a href="http://code.google.com/p/zaproxy/" target="_blank">ZAP</a> is a penetration testing tool for identifying vulnerabilities in web applications to help educate and defend our software communities.<br />The team have just released a 2.0 from the previous 1.4 build, so quite a big milestone.<br />There's a great blog article about the new release features <a href="http://owasp.blogspot.ca/2013/01/owasp-zed-attack-proxy-v-200.html" target="_blank">here</a> on the OWASP blog by the ZAP project leader Simon Bennetts. Its a very active open source project that I'm pleased to be currently contributing to.</p>

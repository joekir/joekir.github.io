<p>The definition of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Idempotence" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Idempotence</a> in computer science is that an operation can be repeatedly called and still produce the same result.</p>
<p>This identity explains it well:<br />
<blockquote class="tr_bq">f(f(x)) = f(x) for all x</p></blockquote>
<p>but x does not necessarily have to equal f(x) for all x</p>
<p>This is such a desirable goal of all code that we write. Here are some examples that occurred to me recently</p>
<p><b>example 1</b> - Software Testing<br />If you cannot ensure idempotency of a test then every time you run a test you would have to recreate your data as its result is dependent on the state of the initial result.</p>
<p><b>example 2</b> - <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/b/wesdyer/archive/2008/01/11/the-marvels-of-monads.aspx" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Monads</a><br />Monads need to allow associative composition of functions, where compose "binds" two functions<br />f.Compose(g.Compose(h)) = (f.Compose(g)).Compose(h)<br />If these functions were not idempotent then associative condition of Monads could not be satisfied.</p>
<p><b>example 3</b> - <a href="http://jcalcote.wordpress.com/2008/10/16/put-or-post-the-rest-of-the-story/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">HTTP REST</a> (REpresentational State Transfer)<br />GET, HEAD, PUT and DELETE are idempotent whereas HTTP POST is not. Observe how the majority of the operations here must be able to return the same result from multiple calls.</p>
<p><b>example 4</b> - Asynchronous functional programming<br />If you want to spin off multiple asynchronous tasks and not worry about a function being called twice on the target object, you should design the function to satisfy idempotence, then it is just a case of "may the fastest thread win".</p>
<p>I'm hoping to keep this word in mind as a fundamental design principle when writing code in future.</p>
